# Welcome

---

Welcome to our gig helper framework for nuxt/vue/vuetify!

This project is designed to make it easy for our remote team to contribute components on a ticket by ticket basis.

All you have to do is grab the code then update the component assigned to you then send us a PR to complete the work.

**Thanks for working with us - we can't wait to see what you create!!!**

:heart: :heart: :heart:
